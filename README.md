### This project entitles a virtual lending and exchanging bank for crypto currencies using a Stake's API as a middle-wallet.

On the platform users can:

- Exchange between the crypto currencies available on Stake (BTC, XDG, BCH, XRP, ETH, LTC, TRX). Exchanges can be done: 
- - via website (exchange with available currencies the website has)
- - peer-to-peer (post an exchange request and another user can exchange the coins with you)
- Borrow crypto currencies available on Stake. Borrows can be done: 
- - via website (borrow from the available currencies the platform owns) 
- - peer-to-peer (post a borrow request and another user can lend you)

- Lending crypto currencies available on Stake
- - Whenever someone posts a borrow request, you can view the request and decide if you want to borrow or not

What is different from another lending and exchanging banks online?
- It uses crypto currencies, which are currently an online trend
- Has a leveling system that caps the amount users can borrow/lend/exchange
- By accumulating all the taxes from each transaction, the platform can guarantee all the coins back in case of default from the borrower
- Subscription options that enable you to level quicker and find faster a match for your request
- Support page that enables you to chat with the staff about any problem encountered


### Currently the platform is under construction
